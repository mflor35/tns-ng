### Generating Components and Services

```
tng generate|g [type] [name] 
```
You can use the `tng generate` (or just `tng g`) command to generate Nativescript Angular components:

```bash
tng generate component my-component
tng g component my-component # using the alias

# components support relative path generation
# if in the directory app/feature/ and you run
tng g component my-component
# your component will be generated in app/feature/my-component
# but if you were to run
tng g component feature/my-component
# your component will be generated in app/feature/my-component

# This will create four files:
__my-component__/__my-component__.component.html
__my-component__/__my-component__.component.ts
```
You can find all possible types in the table below:

Scaffold  | Usage
